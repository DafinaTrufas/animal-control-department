Once you process the data, you can write the results to a processed_sightings.txt file. For example, you can filter sightings by animal type or location, sort them by date, or modify the data in some other way. Here's an example of a processed_sightings.txt file after filtering and sorting the data:

```txt
Date: 2022-02-15
Animal Type: Mammal
Location: Park A
Observer: John Doe
Description: A deer was spotted near the lake.

Date: 2022-02-22
Animal Type: Mammal

Date: 2022-02-25

```

In this example, the processed_sightings.txt file contains only mammal and bird sightings sorted by date.
